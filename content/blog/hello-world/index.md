<center>Let me start things off by describing the idea behind the creation of Prompt Fu.</center>

<br />

We all have spent a vast number of minutes, hours, years, etc. researching various topics in search of a solution to
whatever problem we had come across at any given time.

We may find a solution and complete the project, and update its documentation; other times, we may jot down a note and
store it some place safe (where did I place my notepad again...), or we may simply forget it and move onto whatever
else needing attention. I am guilty of the latter, the latter latter, and on occation, the latter latter latter.

Prompt Fu provides a simple interface, the Markdown lanugage, to share my thoughts and work, and it is OPEN.

Given that open source has been such a huge catalyst in the world of technology and vastly helpul thorughout my career;
Prompt Fu offers, for starters, my notes, blogs, wikis, projects, etc. as I continually develop throughout my career and life.

As I, and maybe someday others, share, the opportunity for you to contribute and share your thoughts is available and
encouraged! Each blog and wiki should have a comments section found at the bottom of the page. Please, feel free to
comment suggesting edits, start discussions, or to let me know the post helped you in your search.

Additionally, wiki posts have an "*improve this post*" link which will take you directly to GitHub so you can fork, edit,
and pull request to contribute.

With that said, more interesting posts are coming so be sure to check back soon; also be sure to check out the various
wikis that include tech tips and command line fu that I have found useful in my everyday - [Wiki](https://www.promptfu.com/wiki).

In an attempt to leave you inpired, here are 10 quotes about technology that I thought had a certain *je ne sais quoi*.

> Technology is a word that describes something that doesn’t work yet.
> <cite>-- Douglas Adams</cite>

> Just because something doesn’t do what you planned it to do doesn’t mean it’s useless.
> <cite>-- Thomas Edison</cite>

> One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.
> <cite>-- Elbert Hubbard</cite>

> Communications tools don’t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring.
> <cite>-- Clay Shirky</cite>

> <cite>-- Laurie Anderson</cite>

> Hardware: the parts of a computer that can be kicked.
> <cite>-- Jeff Pesis</cite>

> <cite>-- Mitchell Kapor</cite>

> Technology is unlocking the innate compassion we have for our fellow human beings.

> Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.
> <cite>-- Steve Jobs</cite>

> In open source, we feel strongly that to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved.
