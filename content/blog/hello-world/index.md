Let us start things off by describing the idea behind the creation of Prompt Fu.
<!--more-->

We all have spent a vast number of minutes|hours|years|etc. researching various topics in search of a solution to whatever problem we had come across at any given time. The output from this time may take the form of a note.

Often, notes may end up in a wiki system, such as Confluence, a notepad, or what have you; and in many cases, it would not be accessible for others.

Given that open source has been such a huge catalyst, driving change, in the world of technology; we would like to offer our notes|blogs|wikis|etc. as a contribution as we continually develop throughout our careers and lives.

As we, and hopefully others, share, the opportunity for you to contribute and share your thoughts is available and encouraged! Each blog and wiki should have a comments section found at the bottom of the page. Please, feel free to comment suggesting edits, start discussions, or to let us know the post helped you in your search.

Additionally, wiki posts have an *improve this post* link which will take you directly to GitHub so you can fork, edit, and pull request to contribute.

With that said, more interesting posts are coming so be sure to check back with us; also be sure to check out our various wikis that include tech tips and command line fu that we have found useful in our everyday(s) - [Wiki](https://www.promptfu.com/wiki).

In an attempt to leave you inpired, here are 10 quotes about technology that we thought had a certain *je ne sais quoi*.
